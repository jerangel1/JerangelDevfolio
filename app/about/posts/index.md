Hello, and welcome to my portfolio!

I'm a full-stack developer with 3 years of experience in web development. I'm passionate about creating beautiful and functional user experiences, and I'm always looking for new ways to use technology to solve problems.

In my previous role at [Company], I worked on a variety of projects, including:

Developing a new e-commerce website for a small business
Building a custom web application for a healthcare organization
Creating a marketing website for a tech startup
I'm proficient in a variety of technologies, including:

HTML
CSS
React
Python
Node.js
Firebase
Figma
MongoDB
MySQL
NoSQL
PostgreSQL
I'm also a quick learner and I'm always up for a challenge. I'm excited to see what the future holds for me as a developer.

In my free time, I enjoy watching TV and movies with my family. I'm also a lifelong geek, and I love learning about new technologies and trends.

I'm always looking for new opportunities to collaborate with other developers and learn from others. If you're interested in working together, please don't hesitate to reach out.

May the 4th be with you!
